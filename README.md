# Deployment of a web server using Terraform and Docker

**1- In the first project *(deploy-ec2)* a web server is deployed in a single EC2 Instance**

**2- In the second project *(deploy-ecs)* a web server is deployed in a single ECS resource**

**3- In the third project *(ec2-auto-scale)* a web server is deployed in auto scaling group with a maximun of 4 EC2 instances**

**4- In the fourth project *(node-01-starting-setup)* i added a single web server using a dockerfile. I did not wrote the node code but i did the dockerfile**

I wrote the code on my local repository and the pushed to github using **git**, also de dockerfile was pushed to DockerHub.

In all these projects i used a variety of resources like **VPC, security groups and load balancers**, it is my desire to continue this learning process to master these tools.
